Image Crusher/ Glitch Generative Art Web-app thingy, built with::

[Vue](https://vuejs.org/), [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), [p5.glitch](https://p5.glitch.me/)

And love :black_heart:

Special thanks to [ffd8](https://github.com/ffd8) for inspiring this project with the [p5.glitch](https://p5.glitch.me/) sub-library, and the feedback

And my little brother, Leon, for thinking it was cool and giving me feedback :sunglasses:

## Support

Will perhaps expand on functionality in a future version, for now, this is just a small test project for sharpening my Vue skills and learning p5.js, and participating in the [hashnode x netlify hackathon](https://townhall.hashnode.com/netlify-hackathon)
